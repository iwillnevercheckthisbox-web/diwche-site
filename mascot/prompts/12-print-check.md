He stands behind a desk holding a printed sheet, staring in alarm at a dangerously leaning tower of stacked books and paper about to topple. This is the one scene where his eyes are wide with alarm rather than droopy.

Read `../character/character-bible.md` first. Generate in the order below — `pose.png` comes first because every later prompt is matched against it.

## What it does when it moves

- The book tower sways further and further, always about to fall, never falling.
- A sweat droplet forms at his temple, swells, and slides away.
- The red cross in the bubble blinks on and off like a warning light.
- His eyes widen a little further on each sway.

The rig that implements this lives in `../rig/12-print-check.rig.json`.

## 1. `pose.png` — the reference

Attach `../source/diwche.png`. This one is drawn on normal cream paper, not magenta — it is a reference for the later prompts, never an animated layer.

```
Redraw this character consistently and cleanly in one new illustration.

CHARACTER: A small, tired imp. Muted sage green skin (#7C9A63), slightly mottled, with a
cluster of small raised bumps across the forehead. Two tan horns (#C9A35E) curving up and
back, each with three or four dark ridge lines, the left sitting slightly lower than the
right. Large round wide-set eyes with red-brown irises (#8C4A3F) under HEAVY DROOPY UPPER
EYELIDS that cover the top third of each eye. Small flat nose. Wide gently downturned mouth
with two small tusks pointing up from the lower lip. No hair, no visible ears. Big head,
short pot-bellied body, short thin arms, chunky three-fingered hands.

WEARING: a cream dress shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbow, under a plum cardigan.

FRAMING: Seen from the chest up, centred, behind a wooden table that crosses the bottom of the frame. Facing the viewer nearly square-on with a slight turn.

SCENE: He stands behind a desk holding a printed sheet, staring in alarm at a dangerously leaning tower of stacked books and paper about to topple. This is the one scene where his eyes are wide with alarm rather than droopy.

EXPRESSION: eyes WIDE OPEN in alarm — the droopy lids are fully raised here — brows up, mouth open in a small dismayed oval.

STYLE: Hand-drawn storybook illustration on warm cream paper (#F6F1E4) with faint visible
grain. Background elements drawn loosely in pale grey pencil with almost no colour, so they
stay far behind the subject and never compete with it. Soft grey-brown smudge shadows, never
hard-edged.

NOT: vector flat design, 3D render, photographic, high contrast, saturated colour, busy
detail, uniform line weight.

OUTPUT: No text, no letters, no numbers, no caption,
no watermark, no signature, no border, no frame. Square image, 1024 x 1024.
```

## 2. `bg.png` — the background plate

```
A wooden desk running across the bottom of the frame. On the left, a tall precarious tower of stacked books and paper reams leaning alarmingly. A faint sketched bookshelf behind. Empty — no character anywhere in the image.

STYLE: Hand-drawn storybook illustration on warm cream paper (#F6F1E4) with faint visible
grain. Background elements drawn loosely in pale grey pencil with almost no colour, so they
stay far behind the subject and never compete with it. Soft grey-brown smudge shadows, never
hard-edged.

NOT: vector flat design, 3D render, photographic, high contrast, saturated colour, busy
detail, uniform line weight.

OUTPUT: No character in frame — background only. No text, no letters, no numbers, no caption,
no watermark, no signature, no border, no frame. Square image, 1024 x 1024.
```

## 3. `body.png`

Attach `pose.png`.

```
From this illustration, redraw ONLY the character's body: the torso, the shoulders, both arms hanging in a neutral resting position. Wearing a plum cardigan over a cream shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbow.

Do NOT include the head, the horns or the neck — the body ends at a clean flat cut straight across the base of the neck. Do not include the background, the desk, or any props.

STYLE: Hand-drawn storybook illustration. Loose, slightly wobbly ink contour line in warm
near-black (#3A3226) with varying weight — heavier under forms, lighter on top. Colour laid
in with visible coloured-pencil hatching that strays a little over the line and lets paper
grain show through in the light areas. Soft watercolour wash pooling in the shadows. Warm,
desaturated palette: nothing pure black, pure white, or fully saturated.

NOT: vector flat design, 3D render, Pixar style, anime, pixel art, glossy airbrush, uniform
line weight, clean digital lineart.

BACKGROUND: Solid, flat, uniform chroma-key magenta, EXACTLY #FF00FF, filling the entire
frame behind the subject. Completely even — no gradient, no shading, no texture, no paper
grain, no vignette, no shadow cast onto it. The magenta must not appear anywhere on the
subject itself.

OUTPUT: Subject centred with an even margin of magenta on all sides. No drop shadow. No text,
no letters, no numbers, no caption, no watermark, no signature, no border, no frame. Square
image, 1024 x 1024.
```

## 4. `head.png`

Attach `pose.png`.

```
From this illustration, redraw ONLY the character's head and horns, facing forward with eyes WIDE OPEN in alarm — the droopy lids are fully raised here — brows up, mouth open in a small dismayed oval. Include the forehead bumps, the flat nose, the mouth and the two tusks.

Leave the EYE SOCKETS EMPTY — draw the socket shape and its shading, but no eyeball, no iris, no pupil and no eyelid. The eyes are added as a separate layer.

Include a short neck stub at the bottom so the head overlaps the body cleanly. No body, no shoulders, no background.

STYLE: Hand-drawn storybook illustration. Loose, slightly wobbly ink contour line in warm
near-black (#3A3226) with varying weight — heavier under forms, lighter on top. Colour laid
in with visible coloured-pencil hatching that strays a little over the line and lets paper
grain show through in the light areas. Soft watercolour wash pooling in the shadows. Warm,
desaturated palette: nothing pure black, pure white, or fully saturated.

NOT: vector flat design, 3D render, Pixar style, anime, pixel art, glossy airbrush, uniform
line weight, clean digital lineart.

BACKGROUND: Solid, flat, uniform chroma-key magenta, EXACTLY #FF00FF, filling the entire
frame behind the subject. Completely even — no gradient, no shading, no texture, no paper
grain, no vignette, no shadow cast onto it. The magenta must not appear anywhere on the
subject itself.

OUTPUT: Subject centred with an even margin of magenta on all sides. No drop shadow. No text,
no letters, no numbers, no caption, no watermark, no signature, no border, no frame. Square
image, 1024 x 1024.
```

## 5. `eyes-open.png`

Attach `head.png`.

```
Draw ONLY the pair of eyes that belong in this head's empty sockets, sized and spaced to sit exactly in them. Large round eyes, off-white sclera with a warm pink-grey wash in the corners, red-brown iris, black pupil. Both eyes are OPEN WIDE and bright — this scene is the exception where the droopy lids lift. Both eyes wide open, looking up and to the left in alarm.

Nothing else in the image — no face, no head, no skin. Just the two eyes.

STYLE: Hand-drawn storybook illustration. Loose, slightly wobbly ink contour line in warm
near-black (#3A3226) with varying weight — heavier under forms, lighter on top. Colour laid

grain show through in the light areas. Soft watercolour wash pooling in the shadows. Warm,

## 6. `eyes-closed.png`

Attach `eyes-open.png`.

```
Draw the same pair of eyes fully closed, at exactly the same position, size and spacing as the attached image. Each closed eye is a single downward-curving ink lash line with a soft crease above it. No sclera, no iris, no pupil visible.

Nothing else in the image. Just the two closed eyes.

STYLE: Hand-drawn storybook illustration. Loose, slightly wobbly ink contour line in warm
near-black (#3A3226) with varying weight — heavier under forms, lighter on top. Colour laid

grain show through in the light areas. Soft watercolour wash pooling in the shadows. Warm,

## 7. `arm-right.png`

Attach `pose.png`.

```
From this illustration, redraw ONLY the character's right arm, complete from the shoulder joint to the fingertips, holding a single printed sheet out at arm's length. Cream shirt sleeve rolled to the elbow, sage green three-fingered hand.

The shoulder end is a clean flat cut where it meets the torso. No body, no head, no background, and nothing else the hand is touching.

STYLE: Hand-drawn storybook illustration. Loose, slightly wobbly ink contour line in warm
near-black (#3A3226) with varying weight — heavier under forms, lighter on top. Colour laid

## 9. Thought bubbles

### `bubble-right.png`
